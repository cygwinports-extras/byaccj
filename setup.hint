ldesc: "BYACC/J is an extension of the Berkeley v 1.8 YACC-compatible 
parser generator. Standard YACC takes a YACC source file, and generates 
one or more C files from it, which if compiled properly, will produce a 
LALR-grammar parser. This version adds a '-J' flag which will cause 
BYACC to generate Java source code, instead. So there finally is a YACC 
for Java now!"
